# Week 4 Back End Basics
<!-- A one sentence description of the project or assignment -->
This is my fourth week's homework assignment for Dynamic Web Dev. 


<!-- It is good practice to add an about or summary -->
## About

For this assignment, we were asked to design and build our own API, then use its data to influence a website. My idea was to make a library of smoothie ingredients that the user could customize to feed a random smoothie generator. I struggled A LOT trying to teach myself this week, so it's only about half done.

# Notes & Process
* I made all of the element sizes in this site relative to the window width to maximize its ability to stay within the general grid plan.
* Since the event detail text can get very small, I added a hover feature that enlarges event text when you hover over the event (the text doesn't enlarge TOO much, because larger sizes broke the grid and/or spilled outside of the window)

<!-- How you built this project - Include images, gifs, and notes here -->
## Process & Documentation
* I spent most of this week working on the guide and workbook, and after about 3 days I thought I understood what I was doing.... but I could barely figure out how get my own API on saturday / sunday... and for the first time I don't think I can make the deadline.

<!-- Any specific challenges or struggles documented -->
## Challenges & Struggles
* I struggled with EVERYTHING here! 
* It's almost midnight so I'll have to elaborate later

<!-- Any questions you have -->
## Questions
* Can we please review fs? specifically how to reference a file that's in a different sub folder?
* Can we plase review the formatting of GET requests?
* Is there a template we can use for API documentation?
